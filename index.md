# Cleaning and Linking Data with OpenRefine

Before analysis comes the messy work of evaluating, cleaning, and transforming data. This hands on workshop will introduce a free power tool to get the job done: [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/index.html). We will install Refine, create a project, and get oriented to the many features for exploring and transforming tabular data.

## Workshop Survey

After the workshop, please complete the [assessment survey](http://bit.ly/dss_fall2019). This helps us make sure our workshops are always getting better.
