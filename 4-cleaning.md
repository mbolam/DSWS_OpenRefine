# Cleaning Data with OpenRefine

## About the Data

In this demo we are going to play with a data about University endowments harvested from Wikipedia—so it is very *messy*! Since we are trying to demonstrate a lot of features, some of the steps will be very “destructive” to the data (but our original data is still safe).

Download <a href="images/universityData.csv" target="\_blank">`universityData.csv`</a>

> The university endowment demo data is from the [Enipedia OpenRefine Tutorial](http://enipedia.tudelft.nl/wiki/OpenRefine_Tutorial).

The data fields are
- university
- endowment
- numFaculty
- numDoctoral
- country
- numStaff
- established
- numPostgrad
- numUndergrad
- numStudents

## Creating a project
  - Projects can be created from data on your computer, data on the web, pasting into the clipboard, connecting to a database, or linking to Google Sheets.
  - As a reminder. OpenRefine never over writes your original data, and information is *not* sent over the Internet!
  - OpenRefine can accept a variety of data types, including CSV/TSV/\*SV, line-based text files, fixed-width field text files, JSON files, RDF files, XML files, and Excel files. I have found that simple \*SV files tend to work the best.
  - OpenRefine data preview page will attempt to identify the file-type, and the available options will vary based on that file-type. For our University Data, OpenRefine correctly identified it as TSV, even though the file extension said ".csv"
  - When satisfied with the data, click the "Create Project>>" button.

## Navigating OpenRefine
  - Data manipulation happens through pull-down menus associated with each column.
  - OpenRefine only displays a few fields at a time - it is acting as a preview of the data, but the actions taken are on all cells in a column.
  - You can adjust the number of visible fields and navigate forward/backward through the pages of data.

## Text Filters
  - Text filters can be used to isolate specific rows that contain the text. They can be used to quickly isolate rows for further manipulation.
  - The dialog box allows for case-sensitive filters and regular expressions.
  - Regular expressions can be very powerful for querying data, but a bit outside the scope of this workshop. We regularly use a regular expression to find rows that do not have the work:  ^((?!Pennsylvania).)\*$

**Manipulating columns**
  - text filter
  - faceting
  - edit cells / facets
  - transform, `value.unescape('url')`, find & replace, `value.replace("old","new")`
  - undo/redo
  - clustering
  - split into multiple columns
  - combine columns (*tricky* because combining blank cells results in an error)
    - facet by blank, combine only non-empty cells
    - transform, `value + " " + cells["col 2"].value`
  - remove / reorder columns

**Exporting a project or a data set**
  - OpenRefine project
  - many formats!
  - templating
  - export is always a new copy of data, never alters original!

**Automating tasks**
  - Undo/Redo copy `Extract` to txt file (use text editor, not Word)
  - create new project with original file
  - Undo/Redo paste saved extract into `Apply`

**Even More**
  - Star / Flag & remove rows
  - create new column with transform `length(value)`, numeric facet
  - deduplicate
    - sort by, permanent reorder
    - blank down / fill down
  - fetch URLs
    - basic geo code lookup using [Open Street Maps Nominatim API](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) ([Nominatim Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/))
      - create URLs that point at the Nominatim API -- add column based on "country" column: `"https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&email=mbolam@gmail.com&app=google-refine&q=" + escape(value, 'url')`
      - grab JSON from the API using "Add column by fetching URLs" on newly created column
      - parse JSON using "Add column based on this column" `with(value.parseJson()[0], pair, pair.lat + ',' + pair.lon)`

## Exploring and Cleaning Data

**Cleaning the simple stuff**
  - a lot of options in the drop-down menus
  - get rid of white space
    - `Edit cells` > `Common transforms`
  - `Edit cells` > `Transform...` is very powerful
  - GREL = General Refine Expression Language
  - GREL [documentation](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/General-Refine-Expression-Language) and [recipes](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Recipes) are available on the OpenRefine wiki.

**Sample GREL Recipes**
- Clean-up character encoding problems
  - `value.unescape("url")`
- Replace string in cells
  - `value.replace("Pittsburgh", "Pittsburg")`
  - `value.replace("~", "").replace(",", "").replace("-", "")`
- Remove duplicate comma separated entries in a cell
  - `value.split(", ").uniques().join(", ")`
- Convert number with text to number
  - `toNumber(value.replace(" million", ""))*1000000`

**Splitting, faceting, and clustering**
  - multi-valued fields can be a barrier to data cleaning
    - `Edit cells` > `Split multi-valued cells...`
    - record view vs. row view
    - `Facet` > `Text facet`
    - manual cleaning and clustering
    - `Edit cells` > `Join multi-valued cells`
