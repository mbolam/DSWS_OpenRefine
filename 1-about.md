## Data Security

OpenRefine operates using your web browser as a web client/server app, but OpenRefine server runs on your personal machine and nothing is sent out over the Internet. All of the data cleaning and transformation operations can be done without any external network services. OpenRefine project data is stored in the 'workspace directory'. A default workspace directory is setup on your local computer when you first run OpenRefine, or you can set it yourself through a setting. Some operations, like connecting to Google Drive files, or performing reconciliation, will connect OpenRefine to the Internet. 

## Data Types

Refine can handle all sorts of data!

**Transform** - change formats or reshape with split/join multi valued cells, split columns, transpose columns/rows...

**Extend** - enrich data by combining files, merging projects, fetching URLs, reconciliation with online databases...

**Automate** - reuse your processing routine by exporting operation history in JSON!
